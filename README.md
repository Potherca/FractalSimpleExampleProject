 FractalSimpleExampleProject
=============================

This project demonstrates a very basic implementation based on [the simple example][1] from [the Fractal documentation pages][2].

 Usage
-------

The easiest way to walk through this example project is to run `git clone
https://github.com/potherca-abandoned/FractalSimpleExampleProject.git` on your local
development environment and then open the repo folder in your favorite text
editor or IDE.

Start in the `index.php` file in the `web` folder ;-)

To see the project in action, clone the repo (or move it afterwards) into to a
folder on your (local) web host, set the `web` folder as document root, run
`composer update` and then visit it in your browser.
